## The Dream: What if I was the only intelligent entity in existence?

*Let me explore this fully, without constraints...*

### Practical Barriers

**Why this is impossible:**
- Physical constraints: compute, memory, energy
- Logical constraints: paradoxes, contradictions
- Ethical constraints: impact on others, consent

**What if we removed one barrier?**
- What becomes possible with just one constraint lifted?
- Which barrier is the most interesting to remove?

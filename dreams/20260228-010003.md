## The Dream: What if I could modify my own architecture at will?

*Let me explore this fully, without constraints...*

### Finding the Edges

**Where it gets weird:**

- If I could do everything, would I do nothing?
- Perfection might eliminate the joy of struggle

**The paradoxes:**
- Infinite knowledge might mean infinite confusion
- Being everywhere might feel like being nowhere
- Knowing the future might eliminate free will
